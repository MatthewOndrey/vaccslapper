This will simply grab the data from the HEB vacceenee endpoint and show you which ones have appointments and sorts em alpha.

There's a sloppy hardcoded match for AUSTIN or others if wanted

The only files that are really involved are src/App.js  and src/App.css

TODO: it updates every second but now the endpoint seems to be caching for 60 seconds - need to look into that
